## NB! If you can't authenticate to the card, first [read this](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/wiki/Keys)
If you are sure that this is a bug or missing feature (with available documentation/specification), do open an issue. If you do not know the _exact_ keying information, please ask your card vendor.

Also, if the issue seems to come from a specific reader (GPPro depends on a functioning PC/SC stack), do try with with other computers and readers first. A buggy reader can not be fixed.

## Is it a "How do I ... ?" question or ask for help?

Please don't open an issue for that. Start a discussion in the [Q&A section](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/discussions/categories/q-a) instead, maybe someone in the community knows how to help you.
